### What goes on the vagrant file?

3. config.vm.network | How your host computer sees your box
4. config.vm.synced_folder | How you access files from your computer
5. config.vm.provision | What do we want to run as a provision for shell commands. What dependencies are needed? Node js? nginx?
If we dont use provisions, Vagrant will just run a blank ubuntu server
